# Workday Schedule Planner

This is a simple calendar application that allows users to plan and save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Functionality

- When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- As you scroll down, you are presented with time blocks for the standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, based on the current time.
- Clicking into a time block allows you to enter an event or task for that specific hour.
- After entering an event, you can click the save button associated with that time block to save the event's text in local storage.
- Even after refreshing the page, the saved events persist, allowing you to keep track of your planned tasks and appointments.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The current date will be displayed at the top of the calendar.
3. Scroll down to view the time blocks for each hour from 9am to 5pm.
4. Each time block will be color-coded to indicate its temporal relation to the current time.
5. Click on a time block to enter an event or task for that hour.
6. After entering the event text, click the save button (represented by a floppy disk icon) to save the event in local storage.
7. Even after refreshing the page or closing the browser, your saved events will still be there.
